			<h2>Layer 1 - Physical</h2>
			<p>The Physical layer of the OSI model is just that, bare metal.  This includes routers, computer, printers... pretty much everything that is hooked up via ethernet or wifi in some way or another is part of the physical layer.</p>
			<hr />
			<h3>IEEE 802.3 - Ethernet</h3>
			<p>Ethernet (802.3) is the most common type of connection interface.  Connection is achieved through a RJ-45 cable, where the data travels via the wire.</p>
			<h3>IEEE 802.11 - Wi-Fi</h3>
			<p>Wi-Fi (802.11) is another type of connection interface.  Wi-Fi is becoming more popular as people become more mobile.  Connection is achieved through a wireless signal, where the data is transfered via the signal.</p>
